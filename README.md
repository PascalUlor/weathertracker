**Weather Tracker**
This is Weather Tracking console app that logs the weather and current time of the array of locations parsed through the terminal

## Getting Started
The application can be cloned from github.com.

### Prerequisites

```
npm install
```
This command installs all the necessary dependencies
Next you have to Signup on [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/) to get the `API_KEY` you will need to get the weather information

If all goes well, you should see something similar to this on the console:
```
{
  weather: [ { id: 800, main: 'Clear', description: 'clear sky', icon: '01d' } ],
  currentTime: '6/20/2020, 3:41:33 PM'
